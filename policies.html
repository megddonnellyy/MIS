  <h1>Our Policies</h1>

  <p>At EcoCurls, our policies are shaped by our mission to provide high-quality, ethically sourced curly hair extensions that allow every customer to embrace and enhance their natural beauty. We prioritize sustainability, inclusivity, transparency, and, most of all, customer satisfaction.</p>

  <h2>🌱 Ethical Sourcing</h2>
  <p>We source 100% real human hair through partnerships with communities that follow ethical donation practices. All donors are <strong>willingly compensated</strong>, and we ensure transparency and fair labor standards in every step of our supply chain. By maintaining close relationships with our sourcing partners, we’re able to guarantee that every bundle of EcoCurls hair meets our high standards for quality and integrity.</p>

  <h2>♻️ Sustainable Packaging</h2>
  <p>All EcoCurls extensions are packaged in <strong>reusable, eco-friendly boxes</strong> designed to protect your hair when not in use. We’ve eliminated unnecessary plastic and use recyclable and biodegradable materials whenever possible. Our packaging is more than just cute. It’s part of our commitment to a cleaner planet.</p>

  <h2>🧪 Test Strand Policy</h2>
  <p>We know how hard it is to match curly hair. That’s why every EcoCurls order includes a <strong>free test strand</strong>—a small piece of the exact hair you ordered, so you can open and test it before committing. If it’s not the right match, you can easily exchange the full bundle for a different shade, curl type, or texture. This helps reduce waste and ensures you get your perfect match.</p>

  <h2>💳 Financing Options</h2>
  <p>We believe that everyone deserves access to premium, ethically made extensions. That’s why we offer flexible financing options like <strong>AfterPay and ShopPay</strong> on purchases over $50, allowing you to pay in smaller, interest-free installments.</p>

  <h2>📦 Delivery</h2>
  <p>All orders are shipped using <strong>carbon-neutral delivery methods</strong>. We process orders within 2–4 business days, and you’ll receive a tracking number as soon as your curls are on the way. We ship domestically and internationally using packaging designed to protect your extensions while leaving a smaller footprint.</p>

  <h2>🔁 Return & Exchange Policy</h2>
  <p>Due to hygiene regulations, all hair extensions are final sale once opened. However, if your <strong>test strand does not match</strong>, you may exchange your unopened full bundle for a new curl type or color within 14 days of delivery. We want you to feel confident and satisfied with your purchase, and our customer support team is always happy to help with color matching and returns.</p>

  <h2>📚 Hair Care Education</h2>
  <p>We’re not just selling hair—we’re building confidence. That’s why we provide <strong>curl-care education</strong> with every purchase, including tutorials on how to care for your real hair and your extensions. We believe empowered customers are happy customers, and we’re here to support your natural curl journey every step of the way.</p>
